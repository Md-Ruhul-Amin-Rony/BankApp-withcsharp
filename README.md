# BankApp-withcsharp
This Bank app has 5st sattic user with username and pass to login where each user has different amount of accounts on it like(user1 has two accounts- savings account and pension acoount etc), everyy user can deposit, withdraw and tranfer money between accounts.
I have used Dictionary to create static user and Tuple for password and making a list of sub accounts.
for transactions i have shown from account and to account and date time also.
